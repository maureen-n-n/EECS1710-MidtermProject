For the one button game midterm project, I decided to emulate a simple slot machine.
The slots have six symbols: banana, cherry, lemon, orange, watermelon and seven.

The user starts off with 100 points, and it costs 5 points to play. Predetermined outcomes and wiinings are as follows:
- 777 : +100pts
- three of the same fruits : +50pts
- two 7's : +25pts
- two of the same fruits : +15pts
- one 7 : +5pts
- none of the same and no 7s : +0pts

Sound credits are listed in the beginning of SlotMachine.pde. All other assets are created by me. Please enjoy!
